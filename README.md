# 2D Cutting Genetic Algorithm

A Python implementation of a genetic algorithm that optimizes cutting rectangular pieces from sheet material to minimize waste.

## Features
- Evolutionary strategy with crossover, mutation, and elitism
- Fitness function based on geometric validation and area waste
- Validates placements using custom logic (no external libraries)
- Configurable sheet and rectangle sizes

## Tech
- Language: Python 3
- CLI-based interaction

## Run
```bash
python program.py
